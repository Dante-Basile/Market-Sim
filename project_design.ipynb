    "1. An overview of the purpose of the project\n",
    "    * The overall purpose of this project is to provide an environment for everyone to simulate the stock market. From beginners interested in learning about the basics of trading to economist enthusiasts developing models to predict trends in the stock market and looking for a simulation environment, our project will serve as a great starting point for anyone interested in experimenting with trading.\n",
    "2. A list of libraries you plan on using\n",
    "    * Core: data structures\n",
    "    * yojason: store game state\n",
    "    * Async: API access\n",
